Heisenbridge
============

<img align="right" width="220" height="250" src="logo/heisenbridge-light-transparent.png">

a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.

Heisenbridge brings IRC to Matrix by creating an environment where every user connects to each network individually like they would with a traditional IRC bouncer.
Simplicity is achieved by exposing IRC in the most straightforward way as possible where it makes sense so it feels familiar for long time IRC users and prevents hiding protocol level events to help diagnose integration issues.

These compromises also mean that some IRC or Matrix features are managed with text commands rather than using the Matrix UI directly and some Matrix features that may seem to match IRC are not available anyway.
Users on IRC should not know you are using Matrix unless you send media that is linked from your homeserver.

Please file an issue when you find something is missing or isn't working that you'd like to see fixed. Also bear in mind this project is still in very early stages of development so many things are missing or outright broken. Pull requests are more than welcome!

Support and development discussion in [#heisenbridge:vi.fi](https://matrix.to/#/#heisenbridge:vi.fi)

Use [matrix-appservice-irc](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc) instead if you need to plumb rooms between Matrix and IRC seamlessly or need to connect large amounts of users.

Features
--------
* "zero configuration" - no databases or storage required
* brings IRC to Matrix rather than Matrix to IRC - not annoying to folks on IRC
* completely managed through admin room - just DM `@heisenbridge`!
* channel management through bridge bot - type `heisenbridge: help` to get started!
* online help within Matrix
* access control for local and federated users
* fully puppeted users from IRC, they come and go as they would on Matrix
* tested with up to 2000 users in a single channel
* optional public room plumbing with single puppeting Matrix <-> relay bot on IRC
* IRCnet !channels _are_ supported, you're welcome
* any number of IRC networks and users technically possible
* channel customization by setting the name and avatar
* TLS support for networks that have it
* customizable ident support
* long message splitting directly to IRC
* automatic identify/auth with server password or command on connect
